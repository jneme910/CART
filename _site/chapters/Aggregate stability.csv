 Property ,Not limiting ,Somewhat limited ,Very limited ,Reason 
% clay ,> 36 ,21 - 35 ,0 - 20 ,Lower clay content results in lower aggregate stability. 
% OM ,> 5 ,5-Jan,0 - 1 ,Lower organic matter results in lower aggregate stability. 
Suborder / SMR Depth to Water,,,Aqu- / aquic within 50cm,Shallow depth to water table during growing season results in higher moisture status. Soil aggregates are less stable at higher moisture content.
"Fe2O3 (Fed, mass %) ",> 2 ,0.5 - 2 ,< 0.5 ,Low free iron oxide (esp. with low % OM) results in lower aggregate stability. 
"ESP, % ",0 - 4 ,10-Apr,> 10 ,High exchangeable sodium percentage results in dispersion of clay and low aggregate stability. 
EC (dS/m) ,Any (with ESP < 4%) ,< 4 (with ESP > 4%) ,< 4 (with ESP > 10%) ,Low EC (with high ESP) results in dispersion of clay and low aggregate stability.
