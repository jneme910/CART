## List:
1. Develop Nitrogen Leaching Interpretation 
2. Write Soil Data Access Version of Erosion
3. Add Soil Organic Carbon Stock to "Air Quality" resource concern
4. Develop Soil Property and Interpretation SQL Scripts to assist conservation planning for specific practices
5.  Develop SQL scripts to help assist in special conservation signups in order to identifying opportunities for conservation. Examples:
    + Golden Wing Warblers can be found in Tamarac bogs where soils data could be used to help query certain locations and customers.
    + Karner Blue Butterfly Habitat Identification.
        + The Karner Blue Butterfly (KBB) is a federally listed endanger species
        + KBB catapillars feed exclusively on the leaves of wild lupine.
        + NRCS and partner staff wanted to identify likely lupine habitat to prioritize for protection under NRCS easments and releated programs.
        + NRCS and partner agencies have begun using these results to help identify opportunites for conservation easements funds to identify critical areas.
        + This process could be used to identify customers.
6. Add thematic maps by map unit and landunit.

^1^Hydric soils are not synonymous with wetlands, but hydric soils are one of the 3 wetland factors/parameters required for an area to be considered a wetland.
^2^Flooding frequencies of rare, occasional, frequent, or very frequent indicate the potential to flood at least once in 100 years.

![Note: The Suitabilities and Limitations, and the Soil Properties and Qualities options in WSS are designed to aggregate data and return a single rating or value for each map unit. The single value is typically either for the surface layer, or it is a weighted average for a specified depth range. This is done to facilitate the creation of a thematic map for the selected item. Representative values (rvâ€™s) are used, rather than the range in properties, and depth measurements are generally displayed in centimeters. The Soil Reports option generally provides the range in values for each soil component and depth measurements are generally displayed in inches or feet; however, results are tabular only.](https://jneme910.github.io/CART/TableImages/future_pratices_soil.PNG)






![A soil map and map legend of the area can be generated from the WSS through the Soil Map tab.  Soil maps were published at certain scales.  Site specific practices may require onsite investigation.](https://jneme910.github.io/CART/TableImages/future_pratices_soil2.PNG)
