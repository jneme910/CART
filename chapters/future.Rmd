## List:
1. Develop Nitrogen Leaching Interpretation 
2. Write a SQL Script (Soil Data Access) Version of Erosion
3. Add Soil Organic Carbon Stock to "Air Quality" resource concern
4. Develop Soil Property and Interpretation SQL Scripts to assist conservation planning for specific practices
5.  Develop SQL scripts to help assist in special conservation signups in order to identifying opportunities for conservation. Examples:
    + Golden Wing Warblers can be found in Alder (swamps-edges) where soils data could be used to help query certain locations and identify customers. (Locating the most productive sights for declining habitats)
    + Karner Blue Butterfly Habitat Identification.
        +	The Karner Blue Butterfly (KBB) is a federally listed endanger species
        + KBB caterpillars feed exclusively on the leaves of wild lupine.
        +	NRCS and partner staff wanted to identify likely lupine habitat to prioritize for protection under NRCS easements and related programs.
        + 	NRCS and partner agencies have begun using these results to help identify opportunities for conservation easements funds to identify critical areas.
        + This process could be used to identify customers.
6. Add thematic maps by map unit and landunit.

![Note: The Suitabilities and Limitations, and the Soil Properties and Qualities options in WSS are designed to aggregate data and return a single rating or value for each map unit. The single value is typically either for the surface layer, or it is a weighted average for a specified depth range. This is done to facilitate the creation of a thematic map for the selected item. Representative values (rv’s) are used, rather than the range in properties, and depth measurements are generally displayed in centimeters. The Soil Reports option generally provides the range in values for each soil component and depth measurements are generally displayed in inches or feet; however, results are tabular only.](https://jneme910.github.io/CART/TableImages/future_pratices_soil.PNG)

## Example Thematic Soil Map (item #5 above)
The Karner blue butterfly (KBB) is a federally listed endangered species present in small patches across the North Central and North Eastern U.S. The KBB usually occupies open barrens, savannas and prairies that contain wild lupine. This plant is widespread in Wisconsin’s central and northwest sands. The pale green caterpillar of the KBB feeds exclusively on the leaves of wild lupine.

Wisconsin Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) staff were interested in finding a more efficient and consistent way to identify likely lupine habitat so that these areas could be prioritized for protection under NRCS Easements and related programs. 

Because the presence of lupine is closely related to soil characteristics, staff approached Tim Miland, Area Resource Soil Scientist, Mike England, Soil Scientist and Jason Nemecek, Wisconsin State Soil Scientist, about the possibility of developing a soil interpretation for KBB habitat suitability.

NRCS staff members involved include an Area Resource Soil Scientist, the State Biologist, and the Asst. State Conservationist for Easements and the State Resource Conservationist. Other partners in the project include the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS), U.S. Forest Service (USFS), and the Farm Service Agency (FSA).

The team developed a draft “Karner Blue Butterfly Habitat Suitability” interpretation (Figure 2). The next steps, now underway, are to compare the habitat suitability ratings with field data on the presence of KBB larvae as well to involve additional partners working in this area. Field and partner information will be used to refine/revise the draft interpretation as appropriate.

Jason explains, “The biggest benefit is the “ah-ha” moment when other resource management professionals realize soils can be used this way. By building the interpretation they can see it in action and realize it can be done; they can now focus and prioritize where to spend conservation funds and back it up with the science of the interpretation.” This is how soils data can and should be used to help facilitate conservation planning.
