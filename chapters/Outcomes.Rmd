## Conservation Assessment Ranking Tool Outcomes

Provides leadership within NRCS the ability to  model data and report the natural resource impacts and outcomes of conservation practices, systems, programs and initiatives. It will also facilitates the ability to identify conservation treatment needs and the ability to report outcomes for NRCS and USDA. 

1. Example: RCCP Outcomes Guidance Document. [Click Here](https://github.com/jneme910/CART/blob/master/documents/RCPP%20Outcomes%20Guidance_DRAFT_6.17.docx?raw=true)
2. Data connections (CART-NPAD) [Click Here](https://github.com/jneme910/CART/blob/master/documents/npad_70_051419.pdf)
3. Measuring the success of conservation practice implementation.
4. Using soils data to help validate conservation practices.
5. Providing technical soil services using soil scientist to collect data for validation 

## Conceptual Data Design
`The conceptual data design = practice tables, land unit tables, miscellaneous reference tables, and connection to NASIS MU and interps tables.`

`The conceptual data design = practice tables, land unit tables, miscellaneous reference tables, interps tables and connection to Soil (SSURG) Map units.

## Outcomes Talking Points

1. priority #1 = data design (in progress) 
2. analysis of existing free assets (infrastructure, programmatic, governance, partnerships.) 
    + we expect this to be done by end of FY with an action plan
3. near-term wins will need leadership support and approvals to begin Oct. 1 
    + cost on this TBD by #2

## Leadership help:
Brainstorm a list of desired outcomes for us to focus data design priorities (jobs, businesses, carbon, water quality, etc.)

## Soils Data
1. We need to be able to tag PLU attributes to a soil map unit and interps on the fly with data feeds.  
    + some would need to have pre-generated reference table values based on a script (to be developed by SMEs) 
    + some could pull direct soil interpretations.
2. 2.	We may only be able to do a few outcomes this way with soil data, but we could get the highest priority completed and evaluate the outcome.
