## Conservation Assessment Ranking Tool Outcomes

provides leadership within NRCS for data modeling and reporting the natural resource impacts and outcomes of conservation practices, systems, programs and initiatives; and facilitates the ability to identify conservation treatment needs and the ability to report outcomes for NRCS and USDA. 

1. Example: RCCP Outcomes Guidance Document. [Click Here](https://github.com/jneme910/CART/blob/master/documents/RCPP%20Outcomes%20Guidance_DRAFT_6.17.docx?raw=true)

## Outcomes Talking Points

1. priority #1 = data design and we are on it
2. analysis of existing free assets (infrastructure, programmatic, governance, partnerships) and we expect this to be done by end of FY with an action plan
3. near-term wins will need leadership support and approvals to begin Oct 1 - cost on this TBD by #2

## Leadership help:
Brainstorm a list of desired outcomes for us to focus data design priorities (jobs, businesses, carbon, water quality, etc)

## Soils Data
1. We would need to be able to tag PLU attributes to a soil map unit and interps on the fly with data feeds - some would need to have pre-generated reference table values based on a script (to be developed by SMEs) and some could pull direct interps.
2. We may only be able to do a few outcomes this way with soil data, but we could get the highest confidence stuff running well and see where we land.
